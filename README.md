harmonicwave
============

harmonicwave.nb is a Mathematica notebook that computes the discrete Fourier transform of a (discretely
sampled) waveform, and then allows for the reconstruction of that waveform harmonic by harmonic. This
notebook was used to demonstrate the concept of Fourier Series to the Spring 2013 Calculus II class
at Haverford College

See the notebook itself for further documentation and for details regarding its implementation.
